- [x] Rename from cliv to cliv

- [ ] Version the local extensions, so you can change cliv and it'll use an extension made for that version of cliv

- [ ] Allow switching the default version/environment for a wrapper application, without re-downloading/reinstalling
      a version already installed. Currently how the 'default' one works and 'pinned' versions work are different
      in ways that are probably not intuitive and definitely wasteful.
